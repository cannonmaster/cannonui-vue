import SkeletonVue from '@/cmpStore/Skeleton/vue/demo.vue';

The Skeleton component is used to display a loading state while content is being fetched or loaded asynchronously. It provides a placeholder that resembles the actual content and is intended to provide visual feedback to the user that something is happening.

The Skeleton component consists of a customizable placeholder block that has the same size and shape as the actual content it is replacing. When the actual content is ready to be displayed, the Skeleton component is replaced by the actual content.

This component is commonly used in web and mobile applications where content is fetched asynchronously from a server to improve the user experience by providing visual feedback while content is being loaded. This can reduce the perceived loading time and make your application feel more responsive.

### Example Usages

<div class="phone">
  <div class="phone-top">Skeleton</div>
  <div class="phone-content">
    <SkeletonVue client:visible />
  </div>
  <div class="phone-bottom"></div>
</div>

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the Card component:

```vue
<style lang="scss" scoped></style>
<template>
  <Skeleton
    row="6"
    animated
    round
    :loading="loading"
    height="20px"
    width="300px"
  >
    <div
      class="content"
      style="width: 300px"
    >
      <h3 class="content--title">Skeleton Component</h3>
      <div class="content--desc">
        The Skeleton component can be used to improve the user experience of
        your application by providing visual feedback while content is being
        loaded. This can reduce the perceived loading time and make your
        application feel more responsive.
      </div>
    </div>
  </Skeleton>
</template>
<script lang="ts">
import { onMounted, ref } from 'vue';
import Skeleton from './skeleton.vue';
export default {
  props: {},
  emits: [],
  components: { Skeleton },
  setup(props) {
    const loading = ref(true);
    onMounted(() => {
      // mock async req
      setTimeout(() => {
        loading.value = false;
      }, 3000);
    });
    return {
      loading
    };
  }
};
</script>
```
