## Getting Started

CannonUI for vue can be installed via npm:

```bash
npm install @cannonui/vue --save
```

## Quick Start

Using CannonUI is very simple. In your Vue.js project, you only need to first import CannonUI:

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import './style.css';
import CannonUI from '@cannonui/vue';
import '@cannonui/vue/style.css';

createApp(App).use(CannonUI).mount('#app');
```

Then you could use the CannonUI component in the template such as:

```vue
<script lang="ts">
 const state = reactive({
    imgUrl:
      '',
    title: 'test',
    price: '388',
    vipPrice: '368',
    shopDesc: 'test',
    delivery: 'test',
    shopName: 'test'
  })
  return {
    state
  }
)
</script>
<template>
  <cannonui-card
    :img-url="state.imgUrl"
    :title="state.title"
    :price="state.price"
    :vipPrice="state.vipPrice"
    :shopDesc="state.shopDesc"
    :delivery="state.delivery"
    :shopName="state.shopName"
  >
  </cannonui-card>
</template>
<style scoped></style>
```
